## 📌 How It Works

MindEase processes the user’s message through a multi-step emotional flow:

1️⃣ Detect emotion  
2️⃣ Evaluate for safety concerns  
3️⃣ Provide a supportive coaching response  
4️⃣ Suggest helpful wellness activities  
5️⃣ Track previous messages to maintain context  

> A small message from the user activates an entire pipeline of intelligent emotional reasoning.
